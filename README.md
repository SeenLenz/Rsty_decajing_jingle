# Rsty_decajing_jingle
Rsty_decajing_jingle is set to be a music player with modern features such as a customizable 
shuffle algorithm, and synchronization across multiple devices such as web, android,
windows, and Linux. The aim of this project is purely the practice of the underlying 
technologies such as WASM, rust, SQLite + the necessary Html, CSS and javascript (typescript) 
for the web client. The current state of this project is prototyping, once I'm done learning 
all the relevant info I need to know, ill start the actual development. (so yes, I'm aware of 
the horrendous state of my lib file)

The Current state of Rsty_jingle is still very much in development, and since it's very much possible that i will have to switch the crate im using 
for the gui and music playback dock expect much
